/*
Inputs/Outputs:

image: 256x256 matrix representing the input image. 
Each element is assumed to be an 8-bit grayscale pixel.
M, N: Key parameters used for substitution.
F: Total number of states a pixel's dimension can have.
substituted_image: 256x256 matrix representing the substituted image.
Variable Definitions:

i, j: Loop indices.
m, n: Dimensions of the image, assumed to be 256x256.
Substitution Process:

The substitution process follows the same logic as the MATLAB code:
First, the value of N is added to the first row of the image, modulo F.
Then, each subsequent row is modified by adding the previous row 
element-wise and taking the modulo F.
Similarly, the first column has M added to it, modulo F, and each 
subsequent column is modified by adding the previous column 
element-wise and taking the modulo F.
Finally, each pixel in the image (except for the first row 
and column) is modified by adding the corresponding pixel and 
its neighbors (left, top, and top-left) element-wise and taking 
the modulo F.
